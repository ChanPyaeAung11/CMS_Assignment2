# Theme Detail
This theme is made from air-light starter theme. So, there wil be some similarities. This template can be used for other contents too.

In this theme, content put in the middle. So, it is responsive for tablet and mobile views. Pictures and texts holders are balanced.
Navigation bar is on top of webpage. In the footer, I put email subscription to subscribe to whatever companies put out. I also put socail media icons so people can
reach us on any of our social media pages.

There are 2 forms made. Sign Up and Log In. These forms error check the inputs. Forms can be changed however you want. They are already responsive so, you do not 
need to worry about anything other than editing it according to your needs.

There are 2 pages made. Home page and Blog page. In home page, image and text holders have been placed, along with slides and a gallery, for displaying pictures. CTA button is placed in the center so that people can sign up be quickly redirected to the sign up page without having to scroll all the way to the top. Gallery page is also made similiar to the home page, but with more content so that people can add any post and showcase things in this page. 

# Workflow
First, try out new features and plugins in local development and then stage it using local development or make a siteground wordpress page where you can test out
everything. After everything is sure, mak final sql dump load and upload the changes to production level which can be from siteground or aws. During each process,
upload al updates to github repo so that you know what happened, can find the error if needed and use version control when necessary.
