# Theme Detail
This theme is made from air-light starter theme. So, there wil be some similarities. This template can be used for other contents too.

In this theme, contents are put in the middle. So, it is mostly responsive for tablet and mobile views. Pictures and texts holders are balanced.
Navigation bar is ion top of webpage. In the footer, I put email subscription to subscribe to whatever comapnies put out. I also put socai licons so people can
go into any social network pages they can.

There are 2 forms made. Sign Up and Log In. These forms error check the inputs. Forms can be changed however you want. They are already responsive so, you do not 
need to worr about antyhing other than putting things you want.

There are 2 pages made. Home page and Blog page. In home page, I put image and text holders, slides, gallery, I put CTA button necessary so that people can hvae
idea of the what the website is about. In gallery page, I also make it like home page but more so that people can add any blog, post related contents and showcase
things in this page. 

# Workflow
First, try out new features and plugins in local development and then stage it using local development or make a siteground wordpress page where you can test out
everything. After everything is sure, mak final sql dump load and upload the changes to production level which can be from siteground or aws. During each process,
upload al updates to github repo so that you know what happened, can find the error if needed and use version control when necessary.
